# 🏗️ New Architecture: Avoiding Puppeteer-Electron Conflicts

## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

**Puppeteer + Electron = Disaster** 🚨

Your scrapers were getting stuck because:
- **Puppeteer** tries to launch its own Chromium instance
- **Electron** already has its own Chromium bundled
- **Conflict**: Two Chromium processes fighting for resources
- **Result**: Scrapers hang, freeze, or fail completely

## ✅ The Solution: Separate Scraping Service

Instead of running scrapers inside Electron, we created a **dedicated Node.js scraping service** that runs independently.

## 🏗️ New Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐    HTTP API    ┌─────────────────────┐
│                 │ ◄─────────────► │                     │
│   Dashboard     │                │  Scraping Service   │
│   (React App)   │                │  (Node.js + Puppeteer) │
│                 │                │                     │
└─────────────────┘                └─────────────────────┘
        │                                    │
        │                                    │
        ▼                                    ▼
┌─────────────────┐                ┌─────────────────────┐
│                 │                │                     │
│   Browser       │                │   Your Scrapers     │
│   Scraping      │                │   (punchline, sfpl, │
│   (Fallback)    │                │    gamh, etc.)      │
│                 │                │                     │
└─────────────────┘                └─────────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Dedicated Scraping Service** (Port 3002)
- Runs independently from your dashboard
- Uses your existing scrapers with Puppeteer
- No Electron conflicts
- Serves data via HTTP API

### 2. **Dashboard Integration** (Port 3000)
- Tries to connect to scraping service first
- Falls back to browser scraping if service unavailable
- No Puppeteer dependencies
- Clean separation of concerns

### 3. **Automatic Fallback**
- If scraping service is down → browser scraping
- If browser scraping fails → sample events
- Always functional, never stuck

## 📁 New Files

- `scraping-service.js` - Dedicated scraping service
- `start-scraping-service.sh` - Startup script for service
- Updated `EventScraper.ts` - Connects to service

## 🔧 How to Use

### Start the Scraping Service
```bash
./start-scraping-service.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 SF Dashboard Dedicated Scraping Service running on port 3001
📊 Database initialized at: /Users/bem/.around-town-dashboard.db
🔍 Scrapers ready: 15 available
🌐 API available at: http://localhost:3001
💚 Health check: http://localhost:3001/health
```

### Start Your Dashboard
```bash
./start-dashboard.sh
```

**Dashboard will be available at:** `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### 1. **Test Scraping Service Health**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### 2. **Check Available Scrapers**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/scrapers
```

### 3. **Run All Scrapers**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/scrapers/run-all
```

### 4. **Get Events**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/events
```

## 🎯 Benefits of New Architecture

### ✅ **No More Conflicts**
- Puppeteer runs independently
- Electron doesn't interfere
- Scrapers work reliably

### ✅ **Better Performance**
- Dedicated process for scraping
- No resource sharing issues
- Faster event loading

### ✅ **Easier Debugging**
- Separate logs for scraping
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to troubleshoot

### ✅ **Production Ready**
- Can run on different servers
- Scalable architecture
- Easy to deploy separately

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Scraping Service Won't Start

**Check dependencies:**
```bash
cd "/Users/bem/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-ben@sidekickvideo.com/My Drive/Vibecoding/dashboard-vite/backend"
npm install
```

**Check port conflicts:**
```bash
lsof -i :3001
```

### Dashboard Can't Connect

**Verify service is running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

**Check service logs:**
- Look for errors in scraping service terminal
- Check database initialization

### Scrapers Still Hanging

**This should NOT happen anymore!** If it does:
1. Check if service is using correct backend path
2. Verify all scraper dependencies are installed
3. Check Puppeteer installation in backend folder

## 🎉 Expected Results

### With Scraping Service Running
- **Fast loading** from database
- **Real events** from all 15+ scrapers
- **No hanging** or freezing
- **Reliable performance**

### Without Scraping Service
- **Graceful fallback** to browser scraping
- **Sample events** with helpful messages
- **Dashboard remains functional**
- **Ready for service connection**

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the new architecture** with `./start-scraping-service.sh`
2. **Verify no more hanging** scrapers
3. **Deploy separately** - service on one server, dashboard on another
4. **Monitor performance** and scaling

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your new architecture is working when:
- ✅ Scraping service starts without errors
- ✅ Dashboard connects to service successfully
- ✅ Real events load quickly from database
- ✅ No more Puppeteer-Electron conflicts
- ✅ Scrapers run reliably and don't hang

**Ready to test the conflict-free architecture?** 🚀

Run `./start-scraping-service.sh` and enjoy stable, reliable scraping!
