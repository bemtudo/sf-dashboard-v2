# 🚀 SF Dashboard V2 - Scraper Recovery Plan

## 🎯 Current Status: ALL SCRAPERS TESTED ✅

**Last Updated:** August 21, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Direct Scraper Loading  
**Overall Progress:** 95% Complete

---

## 🔧 **CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED** ✅

### ✅ **Browser Lifecycle Management Fixed**
- **Problem:** BaseScraper-based scrapers were getting stuck due to browser initialization conflicts
- **Root Cause:** `BaseScraper.scrape()` and individual scrapers were both trying to manage browser lifecycle
- **Solution:** Modified `BaseScraper.scrape()` to initialize browser before calling `scrapeEvents()`
- **Result:** All BaseScraper-based scrapers now run without getting stuck

### ✅ **Scraper Execution Logic Fixed**
- **Problem:** `simple-backend-service.js` was calling wrong methods on different scraper types
- **Solution:** Added proper method detection (`scrape()` vs `scrapeEvents()`) with type checking
- **Result:** Service now properly handles both BaseScraper and standalone scrapers

### ✅ **GAMH Scraper Protocol Error Fixed**
- **Problem:** Puppeteer protocol error: "Invalid parameters Failed to deserialize params.url"
- **Solution:** Changed `waitUntil: 'networkidle2'` to `waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'`
- **Result:** GAMH scraper now runs without crashing

### ✅ **Browser Hanging & Zombie Process Issues Fixed**
- **Problem:** BaseScraper-based scrapers were not properly closing browsers, causing zombie Chrome processes
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient error handling in browser cleanup, leading to resource accumulation
- **Solution:** Added robust browser cleanup with try-catch, timeout protection (60s), and forced cleanup
- **Result:** No more getting stuck, all scrapers complete within reasonable time limits
